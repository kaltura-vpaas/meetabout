1. Setup a mongo db. I used: https://www.mongodb.com/ cloud atlas
2. Setup a mailer solution, can use https://ethereal.email/ for free testing
3. Decide which oauth providers you want to support, or use routes/auth_local for testing purposes
4. Move .env.template to .env and fill in values with your credentials
